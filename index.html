            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>
               Hello! My name is Alex Lathrop! I am a front end web developer, currently taking a coding bootcamp at the University of Utah! I am doing really well in the course so far, and loving the things I am learning, and puting into action! I am a very driven, and motivated person. I have worked in construction as an electrition for the last four years before deciding that I wanted to switch careers to be a web developer. Being in that field, has taught me a lot of things that will be very beneficial for your company! I am not used to having a lot of down time at work, so i prefer to keep busy. Because of the nature of the electical field, I have to look at the long term consequences of the work that I do. Even though one way may be easier for me to do at the time, it could potentially cause a lot of problems in the future, if something needs to be added to, or re-worked. I follow that same style of work when I am writing code. I try to think of the long term consequences of something, and look at a project as a whole, and not one issue at a time.
