            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Alex Lathrop, and I am currently an electrician. I am
                also a licensed insurance broker, and working to build up that
                business to be able to quit my day job in construction, and spend
                more time with my family. I love exercising, and I am training right now to run an Ultra marathon some time next year.
                I have recently become rather obsessed with nutrition, and health in general, and I am currently following a Carnivore diet, and have seen some pretty incredible results so far!

<!-- AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position -->

<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work -->
<!-- WHEN I load their portfolio -->
<!-- * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them -->
<!-- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation -->
<!-- * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section -->
<!-- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work -->
<!--* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications -->
<!-- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application -->
<!-- * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others -->
<!-- WHEN I click on the images of the applications -->
<!-- * THEN I am taken to that deployed application -->
<!-- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices -->
<!-- *THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport  -->
